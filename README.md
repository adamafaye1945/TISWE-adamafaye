# Proposal 
Following the California Fire, I was thinking some type of map-based disaster relief app. This app solve the problem of fast response during disastreous event because time is very critical.
it's going to be a community-driven platform designed to connect people affected by disasters with volunteers, and emergency services, live tracking of people to make sure they in safe areas. The app can give real-time alerts, emergency requests, and volunteer coordination, making sure that help reaches those in need quickly and efficiently.

# Effect
Many can benefit from this App.

Disaster Victims : They can get help, find shelter, receive real-time alerts

Volunteers and First Responders: can locate people in need, Create volunteer Group, distribute aid to people that requested, join relief efforts

Government Agencies: They can easily Coordinate relief, send alerts, manage disaster response
